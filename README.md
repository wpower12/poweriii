This is my personal site.  On it are a few of my javascript applications.  Some are just toys, others are examples of work done while researching general reasoners.  


The site itself is mostly js, using the jquery.terminal terminal emulator.  

To run a local copy, clone the repo, then from the top level directory:

````
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
